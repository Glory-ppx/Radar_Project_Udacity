# SFND - Udacity - Radar Target Generation and Detection

Here's my solution to the "Radar Project" from the Udacity's Sensor Fusion Nanodegree.
In this project, we simulate a FMCW radar with the following specifications:
- Frequency of operation: 77 GHz

```matlab
Frequency_of_operation = 77e9;
```

- Max Range: 200m

```matlab
MaxRange = 200;
```

- Max Velocity: 100m/s

```matlab
MaxVelocity = 100;
```

- Velocity Resolution: 1m/s

```matlab
VelResolution = 1;
```

- Speed of light: 300 000 000 m/s

```matlab
c = 3e8
```
